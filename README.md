# Proteomics
The purpose of this repo is to compare the performance and usability of three popular proteomics software packages: DIA-NN, FragPipe and MaxQuant.
In particular we are interested in analysing Data Independent Acquisition data from the Orbitrap Astral mass spectrometer.
For this series of tests, we are using a [publicly available dataset on PRIDE](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD058340), which will be processed by all three pipelines.
We will be looking at metrics including the number of proteins detected, the proportion of missing values, and the consistency between samples of the same sample group.

This project is conducted by Swanitha Velankhani Gopu and Mark Ziemann at Burnet Institute.
